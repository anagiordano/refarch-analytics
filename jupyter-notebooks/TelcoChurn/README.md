# Telco Churn analysis
The notebooks in this folder are here to address one of the common use case for companies on competitive market like telecom providers: How to predict if a customer would churn?

They are based on the following source: https://github.com/IBMDataScience/DSX-DemoCenter/tree/master/predictCustomerChurn but we have tuned it to integrate to internal datasources and deliver more explanation for beginner data scientists or a software engineer who wants to understand what's going on.

## Pre-requisite
To run those notebooks on DSX on ICP there are a set of things to be done:
* Have an ICP installed up and running: We have configured a 5 hosts topology.
