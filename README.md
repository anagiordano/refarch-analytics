# Analytics Reference Architecture
Big data analytics (BDA) and cloud computing are a top priority for CIOs. Harnessing the value and power of big data and cloud computing can give your company a competitive advantage, spark new innovations, and increase revenue.
As cloud computing and big data technologies converge, they offer a cost-effective delivery model for cloud-based analytics.

This project provides a reference implementation for building and running analytics application deployed on hybrid cloud environment.
